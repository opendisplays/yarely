Research leading to this software was partially funded through:

* an EPSRC studentship
* the European Union Seventh Framework Programme under FET grant numbers 244011 (`PD-NET <http://pd-net.org>`_) and 612933 (`RECALL <http://recall-fet.eu>`_)
* the UK EPSRC as part of `"PACTMAN: Trust, Privacy and Consent in Future Pervasive Environments" <http://pactman.uk>`_ (EP/N028228/1) and `"PETRAS IoT Research Hub – Cybersecurity of the Internet of Things" <http://petrashub.org>`_ (EP/N023234/1).
