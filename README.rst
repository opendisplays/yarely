Yarely is a modular, extensible digital signage player currently designed to run only on macOS. The player supports a wide range of content types (e.g. images, videos and web content) that are displayed according to a schedule and set of constraints specified by the user. The player also supports external triggering of content through web sockets to enable applications such as display personalisation.
